As Mughal control waned in the eighteenth century, British power expanded. After the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the British were ceded control of the province of Bengal. By 1857, the time of the First War of Indian Independence (or, as it was known to the British at the time, the "Mutiny"), the British were poised to take control from Mughal hands permanently. Nearly two-fifths of the area, however, was left in the hands of quasi-independent rulers, who nonetheless were forced to contend with British power at the center.</p> <h1>Intro</h1> <p>English is a widely spoken language today. It has often been referred to as a global language, the lingua franca of the modern era, and currently the language most often taught as a second language around the world. English in India is used not only for communicating with the outside world but also for inter-state and intrastate communication. Because of the great ethnic and linguistic diversity found within our nation, English acts as an indispensable "link" language. With the Information Technology revolution and most software and operating systems being developed in the English language, a new utility for written and oral communication in the English language has emerged. English is said to be the world s most important language having communicative and educative value. English is used all over the world not out of any imposition but because of the realization that it has certain advantages.<br><br>Indian languages in their conversations. Indians abruptly move to speak their conversations. English among Indians who speak different languages is important in some systems, educational and business in India. Foreign movies in India weren t dubbed in Indian languages but were broadcast in English for English speakers only. The reason for the prominence of English is related to the fact that when the British started ruling, they needed mediators who could help them communicate. They turned to high-caste Indians, especially the Brahmins. The policy was to create an Indian class that was Indian in color but English in taste, in opinion, in morals, and in intellect. The British also established educational institutions modeled on British universities, with an emphasis on English education. Missionaries came to India and started primary-level education for Indians, which further spread the use of English.</p> <h1 id="pro">Proof</h1> <p id="proof">Indian Constitution: The Constitution of India designates Hindi in the Devanagari script as the official language of the Union, but English is also accorded official status. According to Article 343, English was to continue as an official language alongside Hindi for a period of 15 years from the adoption of the Constitution (1950). However, the Official Languages Act of 1963 allowed for the continued use of English indefinitely, ensuring its official status.</p> <select id="languageSelect" class="language" onchange="changeLanguage()">' },
